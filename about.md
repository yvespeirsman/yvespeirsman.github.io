<p>Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Yves Peirsman</a>. 
I work as a <span itemprop="title">Natural Language Processing Consultant</span>, to help companies
with the implementation of NLP methods. I'm particularly interested in all aspects of meaning, 
such as document classification or sentiment analysis,
but I've worked on a wide variety of problems including machine translation and information 
extraction from unstructured text.</p>

<p>I hold a PhD in Computational Linguistics from the University of Leuven, 
and worked as a researcher at Stanford University and Stuttgart University. 
After that I was a research engineer at Textkernel in Amsterdam and a content architect at Wolters Kluwer in 
Mechelen, Belgium.</p>

<p>Feel free to get in touch if you think there's anything I can help you with. </p>
