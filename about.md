Hi, I'm Yves. I hold a PhD in Computational Linguistics from the University of Leuven, 
and worked as a researcher at Stanford University and Stuttgart University. 
After that I was a research engineer at Textkernel in Amsterdam and a content architect at Wolters Kluwer in 
Mechelen, Belgium. These days I work as a Natural Language Processing consultant, so feel free
to get in touch if you think I can help you with anything.
